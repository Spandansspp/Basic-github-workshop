  setq [variable] [Value/(read)] - assigns valut to a variable.
  	Example: setq a 5
  		 5
  		 + a 5
  		 10

  car - used to print first element of the list(upper case letters) -->> also written as first.
  	() - all elements inside braces are considered as single

  cdr - prints all elements of list except first -->> cdr=rest

  cons - merges first element with rest of th elements.

  append - merge two or more lists into a single list.

  last - displays last element of the list.(upper case)

  member - lists all elements after a certain element in the list if that is present in the list.
  	Example: member 't '(p a t t e r n)
  		(T T E R N)

  reverse - diaplays the elements of the list in reverse order
  	Example:  reverse '(a s d fg )
  		(FG D S A)

  length - displays the total number of elements in a list
  	Example: length '(a b c)
  		3
  defun [function_name()] - creates a function
  	Example: (defun sq() (princ " Enter a no. ")
                  (setq r (read))
                  (princ ( * r r))
                  )
  	=>	SQ

  		(sq)
  		Enter a no. 2
  		4
  		4

  (Q.1)
  (defun avg() (princ "Enter three nos.: ")
             (setq a (read))
             (setq b (read))
             (setq c (read))
             (setq sum (+ a b c))
             ( / sum 3)
  )

  (avg)
  Enter three nos.: 123 14 323
  460/3


  (Q.2)
  (defun rectangle() (princ "Enter length and breadth:")
                   (setq l (read))
                   (setq b (read))
                   (setq sum (+ l b))
                   (princ (* l b))
                   (* 2 sum)
  )


  Enter length and breadth:12 2
  24
  28


  (Q.3)
   (defun sq() (princ "Enter length:")
                   (setq l (read))
                   (princ (* l l))
                   (* 4 l)
                   )

  (sq)
  Enter length:6
